---Motion Planning with Jackal---
--------ROS--------MoveIt--------

First step was to explore the jackal using the already provided package for it (jackal_simulator) to get familiar with it and try its simulations. 

Next, using MoveIt package to do motion planning. However, in this step no obstacles added just trying to move the jackal alone. 

Third step is to edit the xacro file for jackal to add some obstacles and create a new configuration package using MoveIt and try moving it around.

Finally, adding the motion planning part to the robot and obstacles described in the xacro file.
